# MedReport AI

MedReport is an AI app that lets users quickly understand complicated medical reports.


## Setup
Assuming you have Python installed, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Next, create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key. Since this app is made entirely in Python (with the help of Streamlit), you just need to run `streamlit run app.py` to start.


## Demo
Below, you can see a demo to show what MedReport is capable of. Currently, it provides a summary of your PDF and lets you query for more info. The sample medical report can be found in the root directory of this repo, and it is provided [this website.](https://lab.mlaw.gov.sg/files/Sample-filled-in-MR.pdf)
